# Digital-register-uniproject
My university project. Framework used: Qt (Qt Quick). Languages used: C++ and QML. Basically it's just a digital version of a regular school register.
It's possibilites are:
- adding groups 
- adding students
- adding students to your groups
- database structure
- account creation
But it's still not finished yet, so there's a lot more to come.
